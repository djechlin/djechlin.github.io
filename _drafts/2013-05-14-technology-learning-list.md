This is a running list of technologies I have been inspired to learn and what has drawn me to them, and what I think I would get out of becoming proficient. They are in no particular order.

1. **Ruby and Rails** - kind of an obvious thing to want to learn. There are a ton of shops doing it and as far as I can tell the philosophy goes like, if you follow our way, you can have a pretty solidly functional web product in a pretty quick amount of time.

    I've heard it described as taking root in the Midwestern blue collar mentality, and it indeed is very popular in Chicago. I kind of like that. The idea is that the highly opinionated technologists at the top set the Ruby way, and everyone else follows it. Even though I also like being highly opinionated and would expect to often react, "Wait no, that's wrong!" when developing it, I have two very important opinions that make this work:

    1. It's okay to do something a little wrong as long as you figure out the right way to do it first, and measure the difference.

    2. Having an easily identifiable convention and having a universal convention are both far more important than a micrometric approach to best practice.

    From what I can tell, the Rails community and ecosystem begins with the very beginner and runs up to the full professional. That's an atmosphere I prefer learning in.

2. **Groovy** - So I'm kind of team Java. Java I view as consisting of three components: an ecosystem, a language, and a virtual machine. Only one of those three things is bad. I would like to learn Groovy so I have a scriptable and functional version of Java at my fingertips...  while also being able to leverage every library I've ever dreamt of.

3. **Scala** - The real Java 2.0. The language has struck me as very elegant and terse in all the right ways. My biggest complaint with Java is its lack of functional support. My second biggest complaint with Java is its boilerplate in defining and creating new classes. I don't like this because a small class is very often a good decision solution, and the sheer number of lines of code it takes to produce one makes you feel maybe you did this wrong.

    So Scala, because I want to learn functional programming, while leveraging the Java ecosystem.

4. **Grails, or Play** - just to make Groovy and/or Scala all the way usable.

5. **browser technologies: jQuery, CSS, LESS** - in my current position I'm working my way through the rest of the stack to become a full stack developer. Still missing some pieces though and want to become strong enough here I can just say I'm full stack instead of learning it.

6. **Node.js** - mastering through work projects currently. Still seeing how it's doing in ecosystem. My team is writing what we hope will become the universal logging framework. C.f. Java where every real library uses slf4j already.

7. **Python** - it's less of a priority since it's kind of made redundant if I learn Ruby or Groovy, but I'm still vaguely interested in it.

8. **MongoDB** - is it my imagination or are start-ups getting the hang of MongoDB with much less need for a real DBA than the ones using MySQL?
