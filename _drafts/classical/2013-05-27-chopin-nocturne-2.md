[Here's a recording.](http://grooveshark.com/s/Nocturne+No+2+Op+9+E+Flat/2LRoRe?src=5) Not sure if it's my favorite. I think Chopin's music, and I take a particular liking to his Nocturnes, is an important step in learning what is the responsibility of the composer and what is the responsibility of the performer in a piece.  I won't say anything stronger than "important step," because outside of some other romantic-era composers, I'm not sure if I've fully heard this effect, but there it is.

This Nocturne I am still figuring out. I certainly like it a lot. It sits on the cusp of dark and light to me, as if dark or the night came but there was very little reaction or worry to it, just some peaceful acceptance and a little happiness. It, honestly strikes me as a very deep piece. Whatever statements it might hold or make on the nature of life or death, they're beyond things I've realized myself but are still comprehensible, so I listen to the piece.

And yes, this rather pretentious blurb reflects the fact that the feeling, and the "peace" I associate with this piece, I really have no idea how to articulate. It has bested me. I'm open to thoughts.
