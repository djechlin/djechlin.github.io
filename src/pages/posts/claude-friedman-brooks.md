I asked Claude to write a short essay on a neutral topic three times: first in a neutral voice, then in the voices of Tom Friedman and David Brooks. You can use this to make fun of these writers, or to contemplate how "argument" and "style" can be separated. Without further ado...

## Version 1: Claude's default tone (kinda boring)

Rising rent prices have become an unsustainable burden across American cities, with many residents now spending well over the recommended 30% of their income on housing. This crisis affects not just low-income residents but also middle-class families and young professionals, forcing them to delay major life decisions or relocate to distant suburbs. The ripple effects extend beyond individual households to impact local businesses, which struggle to retain workers, and community stability as long-term residents are displaced.
The root cause of excessive rents lies primarily in artificial supply constraints rather than pure market forces. While factors like population growth and construction costs play a role, restrictive zoning laws—particularly single-family zoning—dramatically limit the amount of housing that can be built in desirable areas. These restrictions effectively guarantee housing scarcity by making it illegal to build apartments, duplexes, or other multi-family units in most residential areas, even when there's strong market demand for such housing options.

One concrete policy solution within most mayors' authority would be to eliminate parking minimums—requirements that force developers to build a certain number of parking spaces per housing unit. These mandates significantly increase construction costs, with each parking space adding $30,000-$75,000 to development costs in dense areas. By removing this requirement and allowing developers to build only as much parking as the market demands, cities could immediately reduce the cost of new housing construction. This would enable more units to be built at lower price points, increasing housing supply without requiring contentious changes to height limits or density restrictions. Several cities that have implemented this change, including Minneapolis and Portland, have already seen positive results in housing production and affordability.

## Version 2: if a taxi driver in Asia said it to Tom Friedman *personally*, it must be true

Last week, as my taxi wound through the gleaming towers of downtown Austin, my driver Mohammed - who holds a master's degree in engineering from UT Austin - told me something that perfectly captures America's housing crisis: "Mr. Friedman, I drive 70 minutes to work because I can't afford to live in the city where I used to study." This story isn't just about Mohammed; it's about how America's rental market has become what I call the "Great Squeeze," pushing out exactly the kind of skilled workers who make our innovation economy possible.

What we're seeing in cities from Boston to Berkeley is the collision of two powerful forces: the "knowledge economy clustering effect" - where high-paying jobs concentrate in urban centers - and what I call the "concrete ceiling," the invisible barrier of regulations that prevents housing supply from meeting the demands of the 21st-century economy. Just as I saw in Singapore last month, where government officials explained to me over breakfast how they've mastered the art of urban density, America's cities are running on the operating system of 1950 in the age of the iPhone 15.

Here's what I learned from Priti Patel, a real estate developer I met at the World Economic Forum in Davos: cities don't need a moonshot to fix this - they need to eliminate what I call the "parking paradox." By requiring developers to build parking spaces nobody wants in the age of Uber and remote work, we're essentially taxing the future to subsidize the past. When mayors eliminate parking minimums - as they've done in Minneapolis, a city I've long argued is America's hidden Silicon Valley - they're not just changing a zoning rule, they're unleashing what I call "housing gravity," the natural force that pulls prices down when supply can finally meet demand. And in the flat world of global talent competition, that's not just a housing policy - it's an economic necessity.

## Version 3: David Brooks, who drinks $45 whisky at airports, lectures us on spiritual ecology

When I visit my local coffee shop in downtown Washington these days, I see two Americas in microcosm. There's Sarah, the barista with a master's degree in sociology, who lives in a basement apartment with three roommates, and James, the retired government worker who bought his rowhouse in 1975 for what Sarah pays in rent each month. Their daily interaction represents not just a transaction over coffee but a profound generational divide in how we experience the American dream of shelter and stability.

The housing crisis reveals something deeper than simple supply and demand - it exposes what sociologist Robert Bellah might call our competing moral ecologies around community and place. The upper-middle-class professional class has, perhaps unconsciously, created what I'll call a "scarcity culture," using the language of neighborhood character and environmental concern to justify restrictions that protect their property values while excluding young strivers from the very communities that shaped their own success. This represents a striking departure from the traditional American ethos of growth and opportunity.

But there's a policy solution that threads the needle between these competing values, one that respects both the homeowner's desire for neighborhood stability and the young professional's need for accessible housing. By eliminating minimum parking requirements, mayors can enable what urbanist William Whyte would recognize as organic urban evolution - allowing housing supply to grow naturally without disrupting neighborhood aesthetics. This approach appeals to both the Bobos' environmental sensibilities (less parking means fewer cars) and young professionals' desire for urban vitality. It's a rare policy that bridges what Charles Murray calls "the coming apart" of American society.
