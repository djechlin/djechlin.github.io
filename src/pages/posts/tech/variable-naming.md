title: "Variable naming: believers v. skeptics"
---

Software engineers fall into two categories: variable naming "skeptics" and variable naming "believers." Skeptics tend to think there are always several good variable names, and spending an hour (or hours) picking just one doesn't accomplish anything. Believers tend to think there is always one unique good variable name, and their code base lives or dies by whether each variable is assigned that unique good name and are willing to spend an hour (or hours) picking it.

I'm more in the "believer" camp, but I concede that variable naming is not in and of itself a valuable activity. Writing good code is a valuable activity, but so is delivering quickly, so this doesn't tell us how much time to spend on variable naming. Teams need to agree on *code standards* for what is a good variable name, and *review standards* for how much time to spend getting there.

Good variable naming comes down to three rules:

1. Unambiguous
2. One-to-one
3. Short

### Unambiguous

### One-to-one

### Short

## Code reviews

Code review comments on variable naming should be explicitly anchored in one of these three principles. This improves author confidence that the feedback is useful and attainable. It's really not okay to spend *multiple* rounds of review naming *one* variable. When this happens, it suggests the standards are not objective, so something in the standards needs to be thought through again.
