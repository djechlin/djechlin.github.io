## Intro

This is a dialogue about improving at soft skills by using Claude. Note these points:

* The human has a lot of insight into their behavior, including their barrier to achieving the soft skill. Claude is very strong at picking up on this and practicing active listening. Claude's reformulations and metaphors help the human push forward.
* The human chooses the direction this goes. Generally Claude gives a few bullets as suggestion and it's up to the human to decide one point is helpful enough to continue with. If the human doesn't have a general idea how to improve their soft skills this may fall flat.
* Claude was a little late of emojis and reactions. This is a miss on its part; certainly relative to its ability to compare Slack to an office setting.


<Dialogue>
  <Human>
    I'm a software engineer working on my skills. I've had feedback I seem unresponsive on slack sometimes. I'm not really sure why but it just seems my teammates expect immediate acknowledgements. I tend to only reply when I can actually get to a work item. can you help me improve at this?
  </Human>
  <AI>
    I understand your situation. This is a common challenge, especially for engineers who often need to maintain focus and deep work. Here's how you can improve your Slack communication while balancing productivity:
    
    The key is acknowledging messages even when you can't address them immediately. This shows you're engaged and helps manage expectations. For example:
    
    *   When someone asks for help: "üëã Saw this - I'm in the middle of debugging right now. I can look at it in about an hour. Does that work?"
    *   For feature requests/tasks: "Thanks for the request! I've noted it down and will get to it after I finish my current sprint task. I'll update you by EOD."
    *   If you need more context: "Quick acknowledgment - I'll read this in detail when I wrap up my current work (~30 mins). Might have some questions then."
    
    This approach:
    
    1.  Shows you're present and received their message
    2.  Sets clear expectations about when you'll respond
    3.  Maintains your focus by deferring detailed responses
    4.  Builds trust with teammates
    
    You might also consider using Slack's status feature to indicate when you're in deep work mode or your general availability pattern for the day.
    
    Would you like specific examples of how to handle other common Slack scenarios?
  </AI>
  <Human>
    do you think it's important to "show" I'm engaged even if my actual engagement won't happen for a while?
  </Human>
  <AI>
    Yes, I do think it's important, and here's why: In an office, if someone stops by your desk, they can see that you've registered their presence even if you can't help right away - maybe you give a quick nod or say "one minute." That visual feedback prevents them from wondering if you're ignoring them or if their request got lost.
    
    In remote/digital communication, we lose all those subtle cues. When someone sends a Slack message into the void, they have no idea if you:
    
    *   Saw it but are busy
    *   Haven't seen it yet
    *   Are actively ignoring it
    *   Think it's not important
    *   Forgot about it
    
    A quick acknowledgment removes that uncertainty. It's not about pretending to be more engaged than you are - it's about providing the same basic social signals that would happen naturally in person. You're just saying "I hear you, I'm not ignoring you, I'll get to this when I can."
    
    This is especially important because without those signals, some teammates might:
    
    *   Send follow-up messages that further interrupt you
    *   Escalate to other channels unnecessarily
    *   Feel discouraged from reaching out in the future
    *   Make incorrect assumptions about your reliability or teamwork
    
    Would it help to develop some quick response templates you could use that feel authentic to your communication style?
  </AI>
  <Human>
    so you're following the approach where you try to make slack work by thinking of it as approximately in office comms? that makes sense but keep in mind it's pretty entrenched and my company and a lot of others are pretty distributed
  </Human>
  <AI>
    You raise a really good point - I may have leaned too heavily on the office analogy. You're right that distributed companies have their own communication patterns and cultures that have evolved beyond just mimicking in-person dynamics.
    
    In fully distributed teams, Slack often functions more like an asynchronous message board with varying urgency levels. The challenge is that different team members may have different expectations about response times and engagement styles, shaped by their previous experiences at other companies or their personal work preferences.
    
    Perhaps a better approach would be to:
    
    1.  Understand your team's actual patterns - Are there implicit norms about response times? Do people use thread replies vs channel replies differently? Are there certain channels where quick acknowledgment is expected vs others where async is fine?
    2.  Have an explicit conversation with your team about communication preferences. You might find that what you perceive as "unresponsive" is actually fine with most people, or you might discover specific situations where quick acknowledgment is particularly valued.
    3.  Consider using Slack's features that are specifically designed for distributed work - like scheduled messages, reminder bots, or custom status messages that set clear expectations about your availability.
    
    What have you observed about how your distributed teammates use Slack differently from what might be expected in an office setting?
  </AI>
  <Human>
    I do think the expectation of me is similar as what you said about offices though. I'm just not comfortable saying I'm getting to something when I'm not getting to it yet. can you help me bridge that discomfort?
  </Human>
  <AI>
    Ah, I see where you're coming from now - it's about authenticity. You don't want to say you're "getting to something" when you're actually just acknowledging it exists. That's a very honest stance.
    
    Let's reframe this: An acknowledgment isn't a promise to start work - it's simply confirming "I received this information." Think of it like an email read receipt or a message "seen" indicator, but slightly more human.
    
    You could try phrases that feel more authentic to your style:
    
    *   "Got your message. Still focused on \[current task\] but I've noted this."
    *   "Noted - will look at this when I'm out of my current coding block."
    *   "Message received. On my radar for later today."
    
    These responses:
    
    *   Don't claim you're actively working on it
    *   Don't make promises about immediate engagement
    *   Simply confirm receipt of information
    *   Set realistic expectations
    
    Does that framing feel more aligned with your values about honest communication?
  </AI>
  <Human>
    don't those sound rude like I'm blowing them off?
  </Human>
  <AI>
    I understand your concern - there's a fine line between being honest and sounding dismissive. Let me walk through an example to illustrate why these responses actually show respect:
    
    When someone messages you, they're often sitting with some uncertainty ("Will they help?" "Did they see this?" "Should I ask someone else?"). By acknowledging their message, even if you're not jumping on the task, you're actually respecting their time by letting them:
    
    *   Know whether they need to find another solution
    *   Have confidence their request wasn't lost
    *   Better plan their own work
    
    Think of it like if a friend texted asking to hang out. Saying "Hey, got your text - tied up with work but I'll check my schedule later" feels more considerate than leaving them wondering if you saw it.
    
    Would it help to see a few examples of how to word these acknowledgments warmly? The key is adding a touch of collegiality while still being honest about your availability:
    
    "Thanks for bringing this to my attention! I'm deep in code right now but I've noted it and will circle back once I wrap this up."
    
    "Appreciate you flagging this - I want to give it proper attention when I'm done with my current sprint task. Will get back to you then."
    
    Do those feel less abrupt to you? I can suggest other phrasings that might better match your communication style.
  </AI>
  <Human>
    I mean ok but can it be lighter weight? this is approaching the level of disruption I was trying to avoid in the first place
  </Human>
  <AI>
    Ah! Now I see - I overcorrected and made it too formal and wordy. You're totally right. The whole point is to be quick and light.
    
    How about super simple: "üëÄ noted!" "üëç on my list" "‚úîÔ∏è got it"
    
    Just enough to show you saw it, without breaking your flow or turning it into a whole conversation. The emoji makes it friendly without requiring more words.
    
    Does that feel more manageable while still addressing the acknowledgment issue?
  </AI>
  <Human>
    oh like a reaction?
  </Human>
  <AI>
    Yes, exactly! A simple reaction emoji (like üëÄ or üëç) is probably the most lightweight way to handle this. It takes literally a second, shows you saw the message, but doesn't create any expectation of immediate engagement or break your focus.
    
    That's actually a really elegant solution to your original concern - it maintains authenticity (you're not promising anything you're not ready to do) while still giving that basic social acknowledgment your teammates are looking for. And it's far less disruptive than even typing out "got it."
    
    Is that something you'd feel comfortable trying out?
  </AI>
  <Human>
    uh yeah I guess, I guess can you tell me which reactions you think best connote "looking into it now v later v eventually"
  </Human>
  <AI>
    Here's a common interpretation of reaction emojis in Slack for different timing implications:
    
    Right now/ASAP:
    
    *   ‚ö° (lightning) - "on it right now"
    *   üèÉ (running) - "jumping on this"
    
    Soon/Today:
    
    *   üëÄ (eyes) - "looking at this soon"
    *   üëç (thumbs up) - "got it, will handle"
    
    Later/Eventually:
    
    *   ‚úÖ (check mark) - "noted for later"
    *   üìù (memo) - "added to my list"
    
    But honestly, most teams don't parse reaction meanings this precisely - any reaction generally just means "message received." If timing is actually important, you might need to follow up with a quick message. The main value of reactions is just that basic "I saw this" signal.
    
    Have you noticed any particular emoji reactions that seem to have specific meanings in your team's culture?
