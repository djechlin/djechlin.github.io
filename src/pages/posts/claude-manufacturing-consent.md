manufactured consent summary

## Claude

Let me provide a summary of the concept of "manufacturing consent," which was popularized by Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman in their 1988 book "Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media."
The core idea is that mass media in democratic societies serves to "manufacture consent" for economic, social, and political policies that benefit dominant elite interests. According to this model, media doesn't typically censor overtly, but rather shapes public opinion through several key mechanisms:
Ownership - Large media corporations controlled by wealthy individuals/entities naturally tend to promote views aligned with their interests
Advertising - Since media outlets depend on advertising revenue, they avoid content that might upset major advertisers
Sourcing - Heavy reliance on government and corporate sources for information gives these entities significant influence over coverage
Flak - Negative responses to media statements, especially from powerful groups, discourage coverage critical of established interests
Common enemy ideology - Using shared ideological beliefs (like anti-communism during the Cold War) to frame narratives
The theory suggests that through these filters, media coverage naturally gravitates toward perspectives that support existing power structures while marginalizing dissenting views - all while maintaining the appearance of open debate and objectivity.
Chomsky and Herman argued this process is more effective than overt censorship because it makes the resulting worldview seem like the natural outcome of free media rather than imposed control. They provided detailed case studies comparing media coverage of similar events that received dramatically different treatment based on whether they served or challenged elite interests.
The concept has been influential in media criticism and political analysis, though also debated, with some arguing it oversimplifies complex media dynamics or understates journalistic independence.
Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this theory?

## DE

from this book does it seem chomsky has any particular political leaning? what does he think of the elites? would he rather we live in a society without manufactured consent?

## Claude

Based on "Manufacturing Consent" and Chomsky's broader work, he clearly has strong left-wing political leanings and is deeply critical of capitalist power structures and corporate/state elite control. The book reflects his anarcho-syndicalist views, though he presents his media criticism through careful analysis rather than overt ideology.
His view of elites is decidedly negative - he sees them as using their economic and political power to manipulate public opinion and maintain their privileged position, often at the expense of ordinary people and democratic values. The book presents detailed evidence of how corporate media serves elite interests rather than public good.
Regarding the alternative to manufactured consent - Chomsky envisions a more democratic society with:
Decentralized, democratic control of media
Greater diversity of perspectives and voices
Less concentration of corporate ownership
More independent journalism free from advertiser influence
Bottom-up participation rather than top-down control
However, he spends more time critiquing the current system than laying out a detailed alternative vision. His focus is primarily on exposing how consent is manufactured so people can recognize and resist it.
It's worth noting that while critiquing the system, Chomsky doesn't suggest there's some perfect alternative where no social influence exists. Rather, he advocates for more democratic, transparent, and participatory forms of media and social organization.

## DE

is the book well-evidenced or just based on chomsky's observations?

## Claude

"Manufacturing Consent" is extensively researched and documented. The authors conduct detailed case studies and quantitative analysis to support their arguments, rather than relying on mere observation. Here are some key examples of their evidence:
They analyze specific media coverage patterns through comprehensive case studies, like comparing how similar events get radically different coverage depending on whether they align with U.S. interests. For instance, they examine the stark contrast in coverage between murders of a Polish priest (blamed on communist authorities) versus murders of religious figures in U.S.-allied Latin American states.
The book includes statistical analysis of media coverage, examining factors like:
Column inches devoted to different stories
Placement and prominence of stories
Word choice and framing
Sources quoted
Follow-up coverage patterns
They document the concrete ownership structures and financial relationships between media companies, advertisers, and other corporate interests. Rather than making vague claims about corporate control, they trace specific ownership patterns and their effects.
That said, some critics argue that while the evidence is substantial, the authors' interpretation of it may be selective, focusing on cases that support their model while potentially overlooking contradictory examples. The book's empirical foundation is strong, but like any work examining complex social systems, the conclusions drawn from that evidence can be debated.
Would you like me to share more specific examples of their empirical analysis methods or case studies?

well I'm interested in fastforwarding to the sort of strife experienced in 2010s and 2020s america. let's not get into misinformation or fringe media sources or social media yet. just consider media coverage of the george floyd protests. can you summarize how the media/mainstream media covered the protests? does this coverage seem consistent with what the elites want? is there a more populist but truthful thesis that should have persisted instead?

## Claude

Based on mainstream media coverage of the George Floyd protests, two main narratives emerged depending on the outlet:
The predominant coverage in mainstream "liberal" media focused heavily on:
The civil rights and racial justice aspects
Peaceful protests and their legitimacy
Police misconduct and systemic racism
Individual stories of protesters and victims of police violence
More conservative mainstream outlets emphasized:
Property damage and looting
Law enforcement perspectives
Public safety concerns
The scale of unrest in major cities
Through a Manufacturing Consent lens, both these narratives could be seen as serving different elite interests while avoiding deeper systemic critiques. The coverage largely stayed within acceptable bounds of discussing racial injustice or law and order, rather than examining fundamental questions about economic inequality, police militarization, or class dynamics.
A more complete analysis might have emphasized how:
Economic precarity and wealth inequality contributed to tensions
Police departments' relationships with city power structures
Corporate influence on policing and criminal justice policy
The role of defense contractors in police militarization
Cross-racial class solidarity among protesters
Local community organizing efforts outside mainstream political channels
The mainstream framing tended to focus on racial conflict and reform within existing systems, rather than examining how various power structures intersect to maintain social control. This aligns with Chomsky's thesis - the debate was contained within parameters that didn't fundamentally challenge elite interests or economic power structures.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects of the coverage?

## DE

okay so this raises one question about how "manufacturing consent" holds up. does the book seem to accommodate the dueling perspective media consumers can get from most liberal sources like NYT and CNN versus nearly extremist coverage from foxnews?

## Claude

This is a really insightful question that gets at how media dynamics have evolved since "Manufacturing Consent" was written in 1988. The book's model was developed when there were just a few major TV networks and newspapers that generally stayed within a relatively narrow range of perspectives.
The current media landscape, with its stark ideological divide between outlets like Fox News and CNN/NYT, doesn't fit neatly into the original manufacturing consent framework. Rather than a unified elite consensus being projected through media, we see different elite factions promoting competing narratives.
However, you could argue some core aspects of the model still hold:
Both sides of mainstream media are still owned by corporate interests
Both still rely heavily on advertising revenue
Both still draw primarily from establishment sources
Both tend to frame issues in ways that don't fundamentally challenge capitalism or existing power structures
So while they might fiercely disagree on cultural issues, racial politics, and the role of government, neither mainstream conservative nor liberal media typically promotes radical economic restructuring or fundamental challenges to corporate power.
This suggests the model might need updating rather than being obsolete - perhaps recognizing that elites themselves have become more fragmented, leading to more fractured forms of manufactured consent rather than a single dominant narrative. The "common enemy" has shifted from communism to various internal opponents, with each side painting the other as an existential threat.
What do you think about this evolution? Has the fragmentation of media made manufacturing consent harder or just changed its nature?

## DE

well has chomsky said anything on the topic more recently?

## Claude

Yes, Chomsky has commented on these developments in more recent years. He's argued that while the media landscape has fragmented, the fundamental mechanisms of manufactured consent have adapted rather than disappeared.
In interviews and writings from the 2010s and early 2020s, he's particularly emphasized how the apparent diversity of views in mainstream media actually serves to reinforce establishment power by:
Creating the illusion of extreme debate while staying within acceptable bounds
Distracting from deeper systemic issues through polarization
Channeling dissent into partisan conflict rather than structural critique
Maintaining what he calls "the bounds of thinkable thought"
He's also discussed Fox News specifically, describing it not as a challenge to manufacturing consent but as a sophisticated evolution of it - creating an alternative reality for a specific audience segment while still serving corporate power structures.
However, Chomsky has been more focused recently on critiquing social media and tech companies as new vectors of control, rather than extensively updating his analysis of traditional media polarization. Given his advanced age (he's in his 90s now) and the rapid pace of media evolution, much of the work of updating his framework for the current environment has been taken up by other scholars.
Would you like me to share some specific examples of his more recent commentary on media dynamics?

## DE

which other scholars?

## Claude

I should actually be more careful here. While there are certainly media scholars who have built on Chomsky's work, I was making a vague reference without having specific scholars clearly in mind. This would risk me fabricating or misattributing academic work.
Some scholars have certainly examined modern media polarization and concentration, like Robert McChesney writing about digital monopolies, and Yochai Benkler's work on networked propaganda. But I should be direct: I don't have firm knowledge of which scholars have specifically updated or extended Chomsky's manufacturing consent framework for the modern media landscape.
If you're interested in this topic, I'd suggest looking into current media criticism and political economy of media research directly, rather than relying on my potentially incomplete or inaccurate recall of who has built on Chomsky's specific framework.
Would you like to explore the modern media landscape through a different analytical lens instead?

## DE

broadly speaking -- which scholars / public intellectuals (so not interested in academics who aren't widely read, appear on TV etc) take up the leftist mantle of pointing out that even fox news and NYT serve the same corporate interests at the end of the day?

## Claude

A few prominent voices who regularly advance this type of critique include:
Chris Hedges - Former NYT journalist turned critic who frequently argues that both liberal and conservative mainstream media serve corporate power. He often appears on independent media discussing how the entire mainstream spectrum works to maintain what he calls "corporate tyranny."
Matt Taibbi - Though his positions have evolved over time, especially during/after COVID, his earlier work at Rolling Stone (particularly his Goldman Sachs "vampire squid" coverage) exemplified this critique of how both sides of mainstream media protect financial interests.
Glenn Greenwald - Though he's shifted considerably rightward on some issues, he still regularly critiques how both liberal and conservative mainstream media align with state/corporate power, particularly around national security and surveillance issues.
Aaron Maté - Focuses on how mainstream media across the political spectrum promotes narratives that serve military and intelligence interests.
However, it's worth noting that none of these figures have quite the same scholarly rigor or comprehensive theoretical framework as Chomsky did - they tend to focus more on specific instances and contemporary criticism rather than developing broad theoretical models of how media functions.
Also, some of these figures (particularly Taibbi and Greenwald) have become more associated with critiquing liberal media specifically in recent years, somewhat departing from the "both sides serve corporate interests" framework.

## DE

summarize taibbi's views since covid

## Claude

Matt Taibbi's positions have shifted notably since COVID. His main focus has become criticizing what he sees as mainstream liberal media groupthink and censorship. Through his Substack "TK News" and Twitter/X posts, he has:
Strongly opposed COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates
Was a key figure in reporting on the "Twitter Files," arguing they revealed coordination between tech companies and government agencies to suppress certain views
Criticized what he calls "woke ideology" in newsrooms
Argued that liberal media has abandoned traditional journalistic principles in favor of narrative-driven coverage
Been particularly critical of how outlets like NYT/WaPo covered stories like Hunter Biden's laptop, Russiagate, and COVID origins
This represents quite an evolution from his earlier work at Rolling Stone, where he was primarily known for investigating Wall Street corruption and corporate malfeasance. While he still sometimes critiques corporate power and right-wing media, his primary target has become what he sees as institutional capture of liberal media and tech platforms by government agencies and progressive ideology.
His focus has shifted from exposing how financial elites corrupt both parties to arguing that liberal institutions and the "elite consensus" pose a unique threat to free speech and honest journalism. This has led some former admirers to argue he's abandoned his earlier systemic critique in favor of a more partisan position, while others see it as a consistent evolution of his anti-establishment views.
