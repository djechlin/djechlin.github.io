title: A sober argument for ranked choice voting
---

I'm a ranked choice voting advocate, but I think ranked choice voting advocates oversell the method a bit, and I wish we would stop doing that. To have an honest conversation about ranked choice voting, three omissions must be fixed:

1. Yes... there is strategic voting in ranked choice voting
2. Voters are humans, not rational automata
3. Ranked choice voting impacts how candidates campaign
