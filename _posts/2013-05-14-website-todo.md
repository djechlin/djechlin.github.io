### Can we get a public/personal separation?

Requirements:

1.  All posts have a visibility: <personal> or <public> on them.
2. Personal ones display under echl.in/personal, which is like archive, and does not appear in site map.
3.  Personal posts do not appear in categories or in archive.



### To-do

1. Links to all public profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow)
3. Weak semblance of a "private" post. The "personal" category is still public but is basically too boring so that I want it on display
4. Category descriptions should display from category page
5. Customize CSS in some meaningful way
6. Posts should appear on front page
7. Figure out how to manage comments (where do they go??)
8. Plug in Olark
9. Functional RSS feed, ideally split by category
10. Get rid of the annoying categories @ bottom of post

Completed:

1. Functional email
