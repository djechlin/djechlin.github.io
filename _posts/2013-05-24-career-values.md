Time to start accumulating these, so they can be remembered and refined, instead of spin in circles.

1. I think in the long term it will be important for me to know statistics, and to know statistics well. I think many of the compelling roles in software shops will be more data-intensive, and many of the really compelling ideas I would like to get to (think, pattern recognition, intelligence) are rooted in statistics.

2.  There's something I've found really enjoyable about participating on meta.SO, and something I really like about Jeff Atwood's blog posts.  This is a type of culture and communication I really like:  being thrown into a wild situation and being asked to tease out and identify community values, whether the community is the StackExchange sites or programmers at large or whoever the heck happens to read my blog.  (To-do: Google Analytics).  It's a type of intelligence I really like and really like using and I need to keep in mind how to identify and exercise that.

3.  I am part golden retriever.  Things like helping somebody put together a career problem or a nascent product or take a next step, or onboarding a new employee, are *really* fulfilling to me.

4.  Ultimately, I know my fulfillment will come from identifying and solving world problems. Wealth ranks as important, but it's not an order of magnitude above the importance of working on a product whose value I understand and am passionate about making happen.

5.  High school through college and the present, many of the best hangouts I've had have happened when it's time to leave or go to bed but you linger for one more sense. That's what "in the zone" feels like coding. And it does happen, and it does feel very good.  It's good to make sure that time happens.

6. I'm somewhat of a best practice fanatic, but much more on the side of identifying and learning best practice than figuring out best practice. I've become much, much stronger in the last year at expanding the number of technologies I can learn and acquire, but ultimately I don't like having to write code in a domain before I know how to.  I'm more prone to read a book first and get excited by all the clean code you can write in a technology than I am to just start hacking in it, and I get frustrated when quintessential problems arise that there's no community or ecosystem to answer.

Also, this type of work is somewhat hit-and-miss for me. When I have to be engaging with code in that murky level is when I am most vulnerable to getting distracted by pretty much anything.  No "in the zone" is going to happen, yet it's also not time to be big-idea or thinking about the direction of a product or learning for the sake of learning something interesting. Ideally I can decouple my "having to do something right now" time from my "learning new things" time or at least be able to switch faculty quickly enough.

But also note that many things that used to count as "learning" now count as "doing."  Wading through Javadoc and reading StackOverflow questions and Googling code samples is very easy and rote by now, whereas that used to be an innovation.

7.  I thrive best when surrounded by people who care about literature, politics, the meaning of life, technology, things like that.  The more values I have in common with my surrounding corporate culture - not just getting the same jokes, but things like, being eco-friendly - the more resilience there is for when I'm having any sort of bad day.

8.  It is important for my work to be enjoyable and blur with the rest of my life, but in a fairly specific way. Writing this blog post? That's part of the fact that I want to live a life that somewhat resembles 100% productivity. Work should be part of my health, and the truth is there's often very little I would rather do over a Saturday or Sunday than learn something. Technology and business (both vague terms, but okay) are fields for which this personality makes a lot of sense.

9.  I think it's silly for me to think in terms of big corporation v. startup. I see ways either can be a good fit for me. In a nutshell, big company means you have to figure out less, startup means you get to figure out more. Any decent job nowadays involves a tremendous amount of learning.

10.  I can work very well when I feel culturally aligned with the team and management, like we are coming together for common purpose.  That's why it's better to go into business with people who are a lot "like" you.  What "like" means may move, but your commonalities are your rock against disagreements tearing you apart.  When I am not in touch with this layer, I do not work well.  In a corporate setting, I think this translates into needing a very good manager or to be working on a very good product.
