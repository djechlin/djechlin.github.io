### Chapter 2: Theories of Form

* Author's first order of business is to show how ahistorical defining a sonata form, or most axiomatic theory, is. Second order of business is to weaken theories that have glaring holes at what listeners actually feel.

* Unity of motif is important and is part of texture. Coherence of art is not anachronistic.

* The composer "wants his intentions audible, not his calculations.""

* Touches Church-Turing thesis: dispenses notion that the great composers are so powerful that anything we don't understand is because we're too mortal.


### Chapter 3: The Origins of the Style

* Beautiful quote:

 > Orestes must be shown going mad *without his being aware of it*, Cheurbino fall in love without knowing what it is that he feels, and, some years later, FLorestan's despair give way and merge with his delirium and his apparently hopeless vision of Leonora.

 One question explored in the classical period is: can the sonata style follow operatic action? It's good to remember this degree of subtlety or poignancy is what's being achieved here. Real, deep, subtle, human experiences and emotions.

* Over-simply, the classical style is about the reconciliation and simultaneous accomplishment "between dramatic surprise and formal perfection, between expresstivity and elegance," whereas composers in the previous years had to choose.

* The early Viennese symphonists discovered not just the orchestral crescendo but the need for continuity, the overlapping of phrases, to hold the attention of the audience. (c.f. Beethoven Sonata No. 4). Early Haydn and Mozart have this problem.

* Note that it starts out where orchestral music is public and professional and chamber music is private and laid back. These intermingle. Everything converges to sonata form.

* Progressing the circle of fifths *suspends* motion in the classical style. Feel this brilliance.

* "Symmetry withheld and then finally granted is one of the basic satisfactions of eighteenth-century art." The avoidance of periodicity is the "fundamental classical menas of rhythm 'development.'"

The author admits that the first movement of *Moonlight Sonata* is a sonata, but in fact does not sound like one. I am vindicated.
