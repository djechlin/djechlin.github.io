[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is a programming Q&A site in which people who don't know what they are doing ask questions, and people who do know what they are doing answer questions to get fake internet points.  Well, these fake internet points are perhaps more useful than most, because they become part of a developer's portfolio and are an easy way to showcase communication skills to a prospective employer and such. But I digress.

If that is your understanding of SO, then sometimes users, like me, do something that will knock your socks off:  they post a question and immediately answer it.  *Why on earth would anyone do that?*  Well, obviously to share knowledge, particularly when someone such as myself solves a problem and feels it should have been a lot more readily accessible to find the answer to that problem, and wants to publish the result, for the benefit of one's future self and others who presumably will run into a similar problem.

Ultimately, that is a lifestyle.  In every day life we constantly solve *problems*, whether they be personal or professional, logistical or emotional, physical or psychological, romantic, social, emotional, or technological.  Training oneself to identify these problems and solutions naturally leads to:  how can I share this information with others?  How can I share this information with my future self at easy reference?  That is what, in essence, I am trying to accomplish with this blog.  Putting my growth under source control, easily indexable and searchable, well-communicated and presentable, so that the information here may be a reference for myself and for others.

Perhaps it's a little esoteric to say "StackOverflow is a lifestyle," but the more specific connection is interesting to me.  And when I notice that my approach to a technological problem and discovering, "Wait, this was harder than it should be, I just did real *research* that others will benefit from," begins to trickle into the rest of my life, I want to share that.
