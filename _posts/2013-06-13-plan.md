Somewhat stuck on the questions:

- what to do when I get home?
- what to do this weekend?
- what to do when I have "bored" downtime?

So one goal I have is making sure I can answer these in a way that is "on track" with the general vision I have.

### During downtime

1. Continue moving forward with Ruby.
2. Write up some of the long-form posts that have been queued.
3. Short form posts: "why didn't have anxiety attack?", grocery routine, having to grocery shop, "bugs first project management".
3. ~~Small site enhancement - categories, not archive, by default.~~
4. ~~Review Mint.com. This will take some real thought too.~~
5. ~~Put a little bit of time into piano. Just try to move forward some.~~
6. ~~TV shows - Mad Men, try to get an episode in.~~ Maybe there's a place you can sit outside of home around here? I don't think moving will make sense until October.


### Thursday

1. Pick up post card for mom on way home.
2. ~~Shave.~~
3. ~~Put away laundry.~~


### Friday

1. ~~Wake up early enough to both exercise and meditate. I think that might mean 6:30.~~
3. ~~Take time to *actually* get flight for 6/30.~~
4. Buy tickets for Citizen Cope. Stop being unreliable.

### Saturday

1. Pick up all the laundry from dry cleaner.
2. ~~See Josh.~~
3. ~~See Linda.~~
4. ~~DUMBO, 1 pm.~~

### Sunday

1. ~~Run with Mitha.~~
2. ~~What are you cooking this week? Probably something rice-based this time. Wouldn't mind quinoa-based.~~
3. Plan cooking for Wednesday.

### Monday

1.  ~~Get that silly check out to CFT.~~
2.  Shopping for Wednesday.

### Tuesday

2.  Anna Lear in evening.

### Wednesday

1.  Emily in evening.

### Next Weekend

That would be 6/22-6/23.  Jersey
