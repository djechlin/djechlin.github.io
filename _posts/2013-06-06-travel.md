Travel is one thing I would do if I could increase consumption a bit. If I continue going in the direction of writing it may make a lot of sense, plus no matter what I do, there are a lot of ideas out there I need to be more exposed to. Where I want to travel to changes fancies a lot, but I think it's worth some journaling.

1. **London**.  I've never been to Europe. London is probably my first destination there - easy to visit, closer, culturally similar enough. City.

2. **Hong Kong**. Less so now, but yes.

3.  Singapore.

4.  Tokyo.  Have not been to Tokyo!  Japan in general. I would like to revisit my study of the language and culture. I've noticed this some recently - the language in a vaccuum I've somewhat given up on for now, especially, business proficiency. Clearly I'm not doing business there. But the culture and history and geography does maintain some captivation.

5.  Portland, ME.  Seems somewhat famous. I want to experience the "quaint" Northeast, too. New Hampshire towns, stuff like that.

6.  San Francisco. I haven't spent enough time there.  I like the Pacific Northwest, of course.

7.  Austin.  Haven't been to Austin yet.  It's a place I could potentially see myself in the future, so probably good to do greetings now.

8.  Toronto.

9.  India.  It is of increasing spiritual significance to me.  I'm not ready yet, but there it is.
