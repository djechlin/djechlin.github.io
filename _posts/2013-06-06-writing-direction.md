1.  It looks like mental health may be a well-defined category. It will also include empathy and spirituality, but mental health is where you want the focus. You do want to write about spirituality but you have a very strong interest in making it accessible, to, you know, people who don't believe in false things, take snake oil etc.

    Let me say that again.  You actually want to make yourself something of an expert in this field.  You have a chance of being able to say a lot of real things and owning it, and taking that shot is worthwhile to me.

2.  Some sub-sections of personal:
    * Stuff of active interest to revising, revise, review, maintain
    * Journal entries, that until recently you were more comfortable doing on paper. Includes just stuff for "today"
    * Reviews and reactions are more personal, but more okay to be public or share
    * At this point it's okay to merely obscure some personal sections from sitemap. I don't think you need a WP-solution yet.

 One sub-section of personal is stuff of active interest that I want to be actively revisiting and revising and maintaining. This is a little different from more meandering entries.

3.  Another subsection of personal is more of-the-time reactions.  "Reviews" is kind of a subset of this, although it's a little distinct.  Reviews is like saying, "I had a reaction to this thing, here it is, so I can move on."

Note in general I think you go too personal when you could go more general.

4.  By the way, still haven't written any "hard" technical articles.
