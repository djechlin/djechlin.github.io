I mostly use credit card, but over a week there's a few purchases here and there that take cash, so every few days I need to pause, reflect on my recent days' purchases and get them in Mint.

So I just did this and observed that it had a lightening or cleansing feeling to me.  It's a form of recentering.  It reminds me how I want to be spending my money and brings me back to taking pride in spending money conscientiously, so that my purchases are less isolated attempted (and usually failed, when this is the mindset) bursts of pleasure, and part of the continuity of living my life with some consistency and discipline.

Anyway, this post is just a reminder to myself of the importance of that, and something that may bring readers to appreciate the value of living according to a budget.
