I've gone to a fair amount of classical music performances, because I work 5 minutes from Carnegie Hall. Classical pieces I tend to learn by listening to a few times, until I start liking them. Then once I like it and recognize it, and can say something special about it, I've "learned" it.

As is consistent with the spirit of this writing project, I want to avoid these pieces simply slipping through my fingers. If I learn it, I need to remember that I have. So without further ado.

#####Beethoven

1. Moonlight Sonata, 1st movement. (I can play this.)
2. Moonlight Sonata, 3rd movement.
3. Apassionata, 2nd movement.

I found this piece a bit magical. It has a very sweet melody, almost simplistically so. I was able to listen to it and drift off into its lull. My thoughts became un-willed and floated, then when the theme repeated I was brought back to consciousness, and generally feeling pleasant that I had drifted off as such.

The magic happened when the theme repeated *again* and I was brought back to consciousness *again*.  But I had never *lost* consciousness. That was one of the most conscious, Hofstadter-ian moments I've had.

#####Chopin

Unfortunately I've already lost track of many.  Mosty Nocturnes.

1. Nocturne No. 19 in E minor. Learning this one.
2. Fantasie Impromptu.

This one clicked when the very end of it, the familiar melody from the beginning repeated, only somehow darker. It caught me by immense surprise.

#####Prokofiev

1. Toccata No. 11. I connected with this piece very directly, because it really sounds like a video game battle theme. It's also the first piece that taught me some of the value of making mistakes. I've heard an original recording and he drops an extra note that sounds like a casualty of the madness of the ending. I wondered if he really was crazy.

#####Rachmaninoff.

1. Isle of the Dead.

#####Ravel

1. Piano Concerto in G major, 2nd movement.
2. Bolero.
3. Sonata for Piano and Violin.
4. The Mother Goose one.
5. La Valse.  (Saw DSO perform!)
