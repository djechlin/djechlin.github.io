* Be aware that "self-limiting thought processes exist."
* Valuable attention is wasted maintaining one's Ego, and the whole process creates a separation from reality.
* Valuing growth and learning is the way to separate from the Ego and become the Higher Self.
* "You absolutely must have an image of yourself as one who is capable of pulling it off."
* Think of a time when your mental state made all the difference.
* Power - the ability to do things - is the ultimate goal of the warrior.
