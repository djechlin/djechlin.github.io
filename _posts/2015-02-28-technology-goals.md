Title: Science and Technology Learning Goals

Here's mine. I'll perodically update this one.

1. Learn Haskell. Consider being able to write something as advanced as an IMAP parser.
2. Learn complex systems. <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0199798109/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">There's a good book on this finally.</a>
3. Improve my workflow: Get my IDE in my terminal via emacs, so I only ever need my web browser and terminal.
4. Learn proofs for the law of large numbers and central limit theorem. This is a good milestone in checking my understanding of basic probability.
5. Learn machine learning, probably via *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*, possibly just via coursework since it's a huge topic.
6. Reread *Godel, Escher, Bach.*
7. Brush up on automata theory and complexity.
8. Read a tougher book on complexity, possibly Papadimitriou.
