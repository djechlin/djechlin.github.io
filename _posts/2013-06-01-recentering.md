###The checklist

*Looking at the past few days*

1.  Think of your last few days of spending.  What did you spend money on?  Is it in Mint.com?  Is it consistent with your financial goals?
2.  Think of your last few days of meals.  Did you cook them?  Were they particularly salty or sugary?  Did you consume stress foods like sugar?  How vegan were your meals - milk, egg, fish?
3.  Did you meditate the last few days?  Were you tired when you did it?  Did you make sittings or Satsanghs?
4.  Did you exercise?  If you ran or did exercise sets, did you reach your goals:  running the whole distance, finishing all the sets?
5.  Is your apartment picked up or cleaned?  Have you been putting off doing that?
6.  Look at the things on your to-do list.  Are there things that are easy and bothering you, but you are still procrastinating?
7.  

*Looking at the next few days*

1.  Where are your next meals coming from?  Do you need to go shopping?  Do you have time to do that?
2.  Where is your next run or workout coming from?
3.  Are you sure you can meet your meditation commitment?  Have you made Satsanghs?
4.  Do you have time to write worked into your week?

*Some extra tips*

1.  Drink chamomile.  It is a soothing ritual.
2.  Push yourself in workouts, this is a good point at which to break under-energized cycles.

###When to use it

It's one thing to realize that one has become out of balance or is off.  It's another thing to know what to do about that.  Downtime scheduled for sitting in a coffee shop sometimes is the right thing to do, but only if it's used to restore balance with respect to the checklist I produced above.  Feeling off, imbalanced, uncentered, or out of touch is a somewhat tense and slightly miserable feeling, so it's important to know not only to trust the feeling, but also knowing what to do about it.
