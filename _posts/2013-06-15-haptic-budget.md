#### Being out of money is a grey line

People budget with different requirements. Some people need to get out of debt. Some need to save more, for things like their kids' college or retirement. Some people make more than they spend and don't really have to worry about it.

However, the vast majority of Americans fall in some amorphous territory with the weird property that zero doesn't really happen where it seems it would. Basically, if you run out of money, you can take a loan, which is kind of weird. Or if you have savings in the bank, you can spend more than you make for a while, which is also kind of weird. Or if you are at prime earning years and are making good money, you can be saving each month and *still* be in a precarious position, because you are not saving enough for retirement. Or you can be taking large loans each month because med school is actually a pretty good investment.

That category covers pretty much the full spectrum of the middle class, from the lower middle class to the upper middle class, so that most people have the dubious luxury of not really needing to care what their day to day or month to month finances look like.

I know in limited doses, this has been a good pattern for me. When I moved to New York, I could get a monthly metro pass for $89, or pay $2 per trip (ah, the good old days). As a commuter the monthly pass was by far the better deal, but it occurred to me I would be willing to take a modest loss for the monthly card because it meant *I didn't have to worry about the cost of getting places.* And as someone who just moved to a big new city, that was pretty important. In short, I never wanted to say "no" to something because of commute costs, *even* if I could save money by always saying "yes." This is somewhat counterintuitive, but important. I needed the ability to microoptimize to be far removed from the trips that took place if I wanted to be in the *habit* of going wherever without caring about commute costs.

#### Austerity is a practice

But, I will make the audacious conjecture and assertion that for most people, not having a haptic budget does far more harm than good. On the condition, and only on the condition, that you have decided all occasions to eat, drink and be merry are in the interest of your well-being, and that furthermore you are willing to postulate that your intuition (I'll get to what that means in a minute) for what constitutes a reasonable splurge won't diverge to infinity as you continue to spend freely, then you benefit from having no concern over your budget.

Essentially, more purchases that one makes are bad for oneself than good. And I actually do kind of mean purchases, not dollars. I pay rent once a month and that is good for me, but I eat out many times a month and that is consistently a little bit bad for me. However, that's not even quite the point. One of the more amazing discoveries I'm made in my life recently is exactly how much austerity can do for one's person. (This is not demonstrated to be true for national economies.) For examples:

- if I can't afford to eat out, I have to cook for myself, which is healthier
- if I can't afford alcohol, I don't drink
- if I can't afford taxis, I don't stay out as late, and get up earlier and do things like exercise
- if I can't afford frequent dry cleaning, I take better care of my clothes

And, this isn't even *quite* the point. The actual point is that **the focus I put into saving money means saving money, and therefore my health is always a little bit on my mind.** There's always some small step I have to take for my health next if I want to stay in budget. Sometimes it's a trip to a grocery store, other times it's produce. Sometimes it's cooking for a few days, sometimes it's making sure I have something quick to cook. It's a little challenging so I always have to be trying. And that means a lot of my mental energy is devoted to things that are a little bit good for me, which means, and I really do mean this, that there is less time for me to focus on anxieties, less time for things that worry me, less of a chance for things I am worried about to start becoming the lens through which I make other decisions.

#### If we spend austerely, we enjoy *everything* more

But, you can still take this point one step further. It *feels good* to be passing up un-pleasures because one is keeping a disciplined financial life. And it *feels good* to indulge in a pleasure because one can afford it and it's the right thing to do once in a while. The pleasure and the un-pleasure might be the exact same thing.

**Learn to enjoy un-pleasures.**  This is what has actually worked for me. I hang out with people who are pretty okay with preferring to stop home to cook something over eat out.


#### So, can we make the grey zero a little less grey, so it can become a part of the austerity practice?

That all being said, mistakes will happen, and part of something being a practice is that it has a resilience that is part of the practice. Slips need to lead to recoveries. Essentially, the point I want to make is that **so much of our lives happen over our budgets, that if we can bring conscientiousness to our budgets, we can bring conscientiousness to our lives.** 

So, this is what I'm still working out. Thus far I have not found a budget commitment that simultaneously says, spend less on eating out, but if you need to spend more on savings or a trip home, that's okay. Budgets are too dumb to have this nuance, but I'm too stupid to spend judiciously continuously.

#### Can we find enough meaning in austerity to self-perpetuate anyway?

Well, probably, although most of this post is about having a spending structure that can reinforce this a bit more strongly.  However, it is good to bring focus to recalling very vividly, constantly, and consistently the actual joy one gets from avoiding un-pleasures. Forthcoming post.


#### Another strategy: become sensitive to not spending money

That's a somewhat tricky statement - become sensitive to not spending money. I literally do mean sensitive: you should feel the pleasure in avoiding un-pleasures as part of a person who spends carefully as much as you feel the pleasures in pleasures when you *actually* enjoy them. More on this some other time.
