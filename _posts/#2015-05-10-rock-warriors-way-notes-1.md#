* Be aware that "self-limiting thought processes exist."
* Valuable attention is wasted maintaining one's Ego, and the whole process creates a separation from reality.
a* Valuing growth and learning is the way to separate from the Ego and become the Higher Self.
* "You absolutely must have an image of yourself as one who is capable of pulling it off."
* Think of a time when your mental state made all the difference.
* Power - the ability to do things -is the ultimate goal of the warrior.
* Call attention to yourself as an autonomous person, capable of making new choices.
* Create deliberate speech.
* Expunge judgments like "good and bad." Stay receptive to information by not using judgment language, then react, don't pro-act.
* Don't say "be careful," it's better to stay receptive than to stay guarded.
