Charles Rosen writes in *The Classical Style*:

> But the later eighteenth century made further demands: the mere rendering of sentiment was not dramatic enough; Orestes must be shown going mad *without his being aware of it*, Fiordiligi must desire to yield while trying to resist, Cherubino fall in love without knowing what it is that he feels, and, some years later, Florestan's despair give way and merge with his delirium and his apparently hopeless vision of Leonara. Dramatic sentiment was replaced by dramatic action.

To me, this is compelling and beautiful. And I've been considering author's other claim:

> Over-simply, during [the years preceding the Classical period] a composer had to choose between dramatic surprise and formal perfection, between expressitivity and elegance: he could rarely have both at once. Not until Haydn and Mozart, separately and together, created a style in which dramatic effect seemed at once surprising and logically motivated, in which the expressive and the elegant could join hands, did the classical stylec come into being.

and ebbing argument that art for all of humanity peaked in the 18th century. Hofstadter writes one of my favorite all time passages:

which mirrors first author's quote. And it is essentially an argument that should humanity make the final breakthrough on artifical intelligence, it will essentially be because artificial intelligence is capable of experiencing and producing art as it was in the classical era. 

In my own listening, probably like many novices, I find Romantic era pieces filled with plot and dramatic action. They are most instantly recognizable as beautiful. By contrast, late classical pieces sound filled with drama and excitement but not quite dramatic action. 

Chopins Ballades and listzs lieds I listen to with my own precise narratives. Ballade 1 is about a person in old age reminiscing their glory days, and it is an artistic experiment in, how powerful and transporting can a memory be? Or maybe it's a young person enjoying the height of a romance, or summer camp, and transitioning through the height of the power of the experience and not quite realizing the moment it had passed the peak, and trying to feel it again, until... it's gone.

I can hear several narratives to the piece, but they all contain the same dramatic action. All narratives are about the transience of a glorious moment. The music expresses it with grace that I can't achieve in prose, which is perhaps the point of art anyway.

My problem is that I don't hear this dramatic action in the works of Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven. I believe it's there, it's just a little more hidden in the historical context of 18th century musical problems, which we expediently and mistakenly call music theory now. Which is why I'm trying to learn music history and theory. A nibble of theory, then try to envelop it in real historical context and understanding and hope I can get a glimpse of the piece in its true form.
