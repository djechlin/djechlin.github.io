*Very* unfinished. There is a much stronger conclusion that can be put in, but this is recorded now until I put it together.

A simple observation:

* On the one hand, we understand very well that the "twentysomething" brain (I use Dr. Meg Jay's term - this demographic needs an identifier and it's the most literal I've heard) is still developing. More precisely, the frontal lobe, responsible for making decisions, is going through it's final growth spurt. And first, it gets really good at focusing on negative things, because it turns out this is important in making decisions from strong judgment.

* On the other hand, with respect to climate change, we're really, really trying to get people to focus on the negative. We think worry is good because realizing this is not a far-off future problem, but more like a now-to-ten-years problem, might be what it takes.

Put these two together and:  what is a twentysomething to do? Many of our mentors encourage us not to worry, that things will work out, that we'll be okay, and they say this with the more fully evolved hardware that is a little more used to not overblowing negative realities and fears. But then we read the news and hear this same generation as commentariat assuring us of the opposite. When it comes to climate, they are not exaggerating or being hyperbolic (sadly and scarily), but they are *propagating* this worry to *very* different brains than those of the solitude-limited twentysomething brain.

So what I'm saying is, if your'e twentysomething and freaking out about climate change, remember that you're reading the same news that has been charged for worries to read too.

But, I don't think this is wrong or misguided. It's not like twentysomethings should get a different reality, they have the same climate and in fact inherit more of it. So yes, it's critically important we deal with this worry. We'll need these skills going forward, and the "negative information" we learn to deal with now are part of our foundations as sane people. If you've approached your anxiety with education or meditation, exercise or medication, then you should at least congratulate yourself for learning a reasonable skill that will be part of what you'll need going forward.
