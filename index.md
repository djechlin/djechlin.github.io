I am a New York-based software developer with a background in mathematics and interests in most anything I can.

### Site overview

Click "categories" in the upper right to find posts.  Better UI is pending.  If you think something on this page is ugly, it's probably under Categories > Personal > Website to-do.  "Personal" is a euphemism for "boring," I use it to keep track of things for myself, but you may find out about some of my interests if you peruse.

### A little introduction

One of the most cogent, inspiring pieces I've read is [an article by Ezra Klein in the wake of Mitt Romney's infamous "47% remark"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/20/what-romney-doesnt-understand-about-personal-responsibility/) (we totally remember that, right?):

> Banerjee and Duflo’s argument has been increasingly confirmed by the nascent science of “decision fatigue.” Study after study shows that the more we need to worry about in a day, the harder we have to work to make good decisions.

And, that is something of my passion: reducing decision fatigue in myself, and others. Behavioral psychology reveals that as rational as a person may try to be, a person's mental fatigue is his or her own blind spot. And that is precisely where I want to empower people.

I have goals like:

* can I publish an insight that reveals where many people in my generation are struggling with a decision or struggling where to cope?
* can I make information from data so that we have less noise as we make our decisions? Can I effect the mental resources in people to turn information into knowledge and beliefs?
* can I create software products that let people participate in a little more formal economy than they otherwise could?

This personal site is an important step in that. I am passionate enough about expanding in writing that I am motivated and inspired to embark in the DIY mentality of putting together a technology product.  This site is made using Jekyll. Markdown I largely learned from participating on StackOverflow, which also taught me how not to get stuck when working on open technologies in the wild.  It is hosted from GitHub pages until I have a need for more moving parts. I don't like using new technologies to not solve problems, hence the "no moving parts" philosophy of this site.

Anyway, once I plug in Olark, it will be really hard for you *not* to contact me.  But until then, please drop me an email and tell me something interesting.

Cheers,
Dan
